# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNNs

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses the **CIFAR-10 dataset** to classify images into 10 categories:
- Airplanes
- Cars
- Birds
- Cats
- Deer
- Dogs
- Frogs
- Horses
- Ships
- Trucks

The dataset contains **60,000 images (32x32 pixels, color)**, widely used in computer vision research.

## ðŸ§  Approach
1. Data loading & visualization
2. Data preprocessing (normalization, train-test split)
3. Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Saving the trained model (`.h5`)
6. Improving performance with **Data Augmentation**
